# Magisk Force 2.4GHz band WifI

Prefer (Force) Using 2.4Ghz Band WiFi (gemini)


## Details

 Mi5 system custom ROM provided ini file for controlling WiFi behaviour. This module will modify `WCNSS_qcom_cfg.ini` in order to change prefer WiFi band to only 2.4GHz. This will force PdaNet to use 2.4Ghz band WiFi for WiFi Direct Hotspot. This will be useful for laptop with no 5Ghz WiFi band support. In MIUI rom, there is no issue, so do not use this in MIUI ROM.
